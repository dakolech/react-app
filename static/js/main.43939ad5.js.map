If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\n * following are equivalent:\n *\n *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @sig (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n * @see R.curryN\n * @example\n *\n *      var addFourNumbers = (a, b, c, d) => a + b + c + d;\n *\n *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curry(addFourNumbers);\n *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n *      var g = f(3);\n *      g(4); //=> 10\n */\nmodule.exports = _curry1(function curry(fn) {\n  return curryN(fn.length, fn);\n});\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/ramda/src/curry.js\n// module id = 59\n// module chunks = 0","var _curry1 = require('./internal/_curry1');\nvar curry = require('./curry');\n\n\n/**\n * Returns a new function much like the supplied one, except that the first two\n * arguments' order is reversed.\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @sig (a -> b -> c -> ... -> z) -> (b -> a -> c -> ... -> z)\n * @param {Function} fn The function to invoke with its first two parameters reversed.\n * @return {*} The result of invoking `fn` with its first two parameters' order reversed.\n * @example\n *\n *      var mergeThree = (a, b, c) => [].concat(a, b, c);\n *\n *      mergeThree(1, 2, 3); //=> [1, 2, 3]\n *\n *      R.flip(mergeThree)(1, 2, 3); //=> [2, 1, 3]\n * @symb R.flip(f)(a, b, c) = f(b, a, c)\n */\nmodule.exports = _curry1(function flip(fn) {\n  return curry(function(a, b) {\n    var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0);\n    args[0] = b;\n    args[1] = a;\n    return fn.apply(this, args);\n  });\n});\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/ramda/src/flip.js\n// module id = 60\n// module chunks = 0","var _arity = require('./_arity');\nvar _isPlaceholder = require('./_isPlaceholder');\n\n\n/**\n * Internal curryN function.\n *\n * @private\n * @category Function\n * @param {Number} length The arity of the curried function.\n * @param {Array} received An array of arguments received thus far.\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} The curried function.\n */\nmodule.exports = function _curryN(length, received, fn) {\n  return function() {\n    var combined = [];\n    var argsIdx = 0;\n    var left = length;\n    var combinedIdx = 0;\n    while (combinedIdx < received.length || argsIdx < arguments.length) {\n      var result;\n      if (combinedIdx < received.length &&\n          (!_isPlaceholder(received[combinedIdx]) ||\n           argsIdx >= arguments.length)) {\n        result = received[combinedIdx];\n      } else {\n        result = arguments[argsIdx];\n        argsIdx += 1;\n      }\n      combined[combinedIdx] = result;\n      if (!_isPlaceholder(result)) {\n        left -= 1;\n      }\n      combinedIdx += 1;\n    }\n    return left <= 0 ? fn.apply(this, combined)\n                     : _arity(left, _curryN(length, combined, fn));\n  };\n};\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/ramda/src/internal/_curryN.js\n// module id = 61\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = function _isFunction(x) {\n  return Object.prototype.toString.call(x) === '[object Function]';\n};\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/ramda/src/internal/_isFunction.js\n// module id = 62\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = function _isPlaceholder(a) {\n  return a != null &&\n         typeof a === 'object' &&\n         a['@@functional/placeholder'] === true;\n};\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/ramda/src/internal/_isPlaceholder.js\n// module id = 63\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = function _isString(x) {\n  return Object.prototype.toString.call(x) === '[object String]';\n};\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/ramda/src/internal/_isString.js\n// module id = 64\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = function _map(fn, functor) {\n  var idx = 0;\n  var len = functor.length;\n  var result = Array(len);\n  while (idx < len) {\n    result[idx] = fn(functor[idx]);\n    idx += 1;\n  }\n  return result;\n};\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/ramda/src/internal/_map.js\n// module id = 65\n// module chunks = 0","var _curry2 = require('./internal/_curry2');\nvar map = require('./map');\n\n\n/**\n * Returns a lens for the given getter and setter functions.
